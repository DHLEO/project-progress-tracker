# A Dynamic Credit Risk Prediction System Based on Federated Learning

A responsive web-based dashboard tracking the development progress of a federated learning system for credit risk prediction. This project is carried out by a team from the School of Computing and Data Science at HKU.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a dynamic credit risk prediction system utilizing federated learning techniques. Key features of the system include:

- Cross-institutional data schema mapping and standardization
- Horizontal and vertical federated learning implementation
- Privacy-preserving protocols (OPRF-based PSI)
- Differential privacy protections
- Integration of advanced federated learning algorithms (FedAvg/FedMA/FedProx)
- Model distillation framework for transformer models
- Security measures including CAE label obfuscation and CAFE gradient protection
